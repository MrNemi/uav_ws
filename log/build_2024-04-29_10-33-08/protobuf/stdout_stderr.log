[31mCMake Error at cmake/gtest.cmake:7 (message):
  Cannot find third_party/googletest directory that's needed to build tests.
  If you use git, make sure you have cloned submodules:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

  If instead you want to skip tests, run cmake with:

    cmake -Dprotobuf_BUILD_TESTS=OFF
